## Inspiration
We had a little BB9e robot, and since it was programmable, we wanted to make an app where we could point our phones at a locations using AR and let the robot move there.

## What it does
A Snapchat lens that allows you to control a virtual BB9e robot, essentially demoing our initial idea.

## How we built it
iOS AR App initially (xcode & swift), but ended up using Snapchat lens studio (javascript), and 3D modelling tools such as Maya, meshlab, and Blender. 

## Challenges we ran into
Connecting to the BB9e droid didn't work because the Saphero software wasn't updated in a while, which didn't let us make our own app. The Saphero EDU app which let us connect didn't provide enough functionality for our needs.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Attempting to make an iOS AR App
- Creating an AR App using Snapchat
- Working with 3D modelling tools

## What's next for Guido
Fully functioning AR App, adding AI for the robot to figure out a path to it's destination
